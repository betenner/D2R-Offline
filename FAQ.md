# Frequently Asked Questions

## Why can't I resume playing a previously created character?

Once you quit the game after creating a new character, you will need to use the TCP/IP button and host a game with that character.

Alternatively, you can use the -FixLocalSave argument with `D2ROffline.exe` to adjust your save files to allow offline play, see the Usage section in the [README](readme.md)

## Why is my map overlapping/not displaying properly?
